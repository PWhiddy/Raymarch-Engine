All graphics are ray-traced in real time. Geometry is defined as signed distance fields.
The player can create wormhole portals that bend light as it travels, creating a very similar effect to that seen in interstellar. 
An example of useage can be found in initialize.cpp

Dependencies: glfw, glew, glm
